# Project Description
This Java project was originally created for the COP 3330 Object-Oriented Programming course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate exception handling in Java using both built-in and custom exceptions.

The program first performs an arithmetic operation to demonstrate a built-in 'ArithmeticException' through division. After that, the project implements custom exceptions for validating username and password. The user is required to create five accounts, and each account is checked against multiple validation rules.

If any rule is violated, the corresponding custom exception is thrown and a helpful message is displayed to indicate what went wrong.
